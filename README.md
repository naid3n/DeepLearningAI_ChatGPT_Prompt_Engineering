### DeepLearning.AI Courses

- This repo contains my notes and codes for [DeepLearning AI's courses](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/). The code has been updated to incorporate the latest changes in OpenAI's libraries, such as the [V1 migration guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742). I continuously add new content to reflect my progress. ðŸŒ±Feel free to learn and collaborate!
